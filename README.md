🖥️ Guardian Live Dashboard
Guardian Dashboard is the centralized monitoring web interface for the Guardian safety ecosystem. It provides trusted contacts with a high-fidelity, real-time command center to track active SOS alerts, view live locations, and access critical audio evidence.

🚀 Key Features
Real-Time SOS Monitoring: Instantly populates active emergency alerts as they are triggered from the mobile app.

Live Map Integration: Tracks the user's precise coordinates with high-frequency updates during an active SOS event.

Evidence Vault: Stream and download the 15-second audio chunks uploaded by the Guardian mobile app for immediate situational awareness.

Secure Access: Uses UID-based secure links to ensure only invited trusted contacts can view live tracking data.

Responsive Web Design: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers so guardians can help from any device.

🎨 System Integration
The dashboard acts as the primary receiver in the Guardian ecosystem:

SOS Triggered: Mobile app sends data to Firebase.

Live Sync: Dashboard listens to Firestore changes and updates the UI instantly.

Actionable Data: Trusted contacts use the dashboard to coordinate with emergency services.
